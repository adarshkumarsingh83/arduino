```
connect pin 13 of  uno to the pin D5 of Node mcu
connect pin 12 of  uno to the pin D6 of Node mcu
connect pin 13 of  uno to the pin D7 of Node mcu
connect pin 10 of  uno to the pin D8 of Node mcu
connect the gnd of  uno to the gnd of the Node mcu 

```


### To Open Two arduino sperate ide on mac
* $ open -n -a Arduino
	* -n = open new instance even when one is already running
	* -a xxx = open application xxx
