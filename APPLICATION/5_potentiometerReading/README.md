# PotentiometerReading 

--- 

this is for demo how the current is flowing from arduino to meter and then based on tuning then \
current is reduce and increated and reading back to the arduino \
meter contains two register internally so the 3 connectors to meter one for +ve ,-ve and other will tell \
the reding of volatage from meter as the output of the meter
