```
sda scl from arduino to pcf8574 board sda and scl 
+5v and gnd from arduino to the breadboard 
+5v and gnd from breadboard to the pcf8574 board vcc and gnd
+5v and gnd from breadboard to the relay switch vcc and gnd 
connect the p0 to p7 from pcf8574 to the realy switch 
connect 8 220Oms risistor to breadboard +5v 
another leg ot the reistor will go to the corresponding 8 led long leg 
then take gnd from breadboard  to the every input terminal of realyswitch and then bring back from adjucent terminal to the led short led to complete the circuit
