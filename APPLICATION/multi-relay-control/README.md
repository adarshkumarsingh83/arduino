```
connect the +5v and gnd to the bradboard from arduino 
connect the +5v and gnd to the realy switch1 and switch2 vcc and gnd form breadboard 

connection from pin 12  from arduino to breadboard 
connection from pin 13 from arduino to breadboard 
connection the pin 12 from breadboard to the realyswitch1 IN pin 
connection the pin 13 from breadboard to the realyswitch2 IN pin 

connection from pin 12 of breadboard to the risistor of led1
connection from pin 12 of breadboard to the risistor of led2
then other leg of resistor to he led1 long leg 
then other leg of resistor to he led2 long leg 
then shot leg ot the led1 to the groudn of bredboard 
then shot leg ot the led2 to the groudn of bredboard 

connect the +5v and gnd to the bradboard from exteranal power  
connect the middle pin of the realy switch 1 to the +5v of the breadboard from external power power supply
connect the middle pin of the realy switch 2 to the +5v of the breadboard from external power power supply

connection the right pin the the long resistor of the red led1 
connection the left pin the the long resistor of the red led2

then connection the other led of the risitor to the long led1 and led2 of the leds 
connect the short led of the led to the gnd in the breadboard from external power supply
